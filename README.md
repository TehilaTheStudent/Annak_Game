# Annak Game

## Overview

Annak is a strategic board game inspired by the popular game Catan. Developed in C++, this project utilizes OpenCV to create an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances the gaming experience. Players will engage in resource management, trading, and strategic placement as they aim to build their settlements and roads.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Built using OpenCV for a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Resource Management**: Players gather resources and trade to expand their territories.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Similar mechanics to Catan, including building settlements and roads, with unique twists.
- **Design Patterns**: Implemented various design patterns to enhance code structure and maintainability, making it easier to manage game logic and interactions.

## Gameplay

### Objective

The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a predetermined number of victory points by building settlements, cities, and roads.

### Rules

1. Each player starts with a set number of resources.
2. Players take turns rolling dice to gather resources.
3. Players can trade resources with each other or with the bank.
4. Building settlements and roads costs specific resources.
5. The game continues until one player reaches the victory point threshold.
